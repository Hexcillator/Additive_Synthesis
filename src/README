This file runs in open frameworks by creating a new project and replacing main.cpp, opApp.cpp and ofApp.h with the attached files. In order to use it you will need to have installed Maximilian library and include "maximilian.h" at the top of the ofApp.h file.
On addition you will also have to include the "ofxGui.h" to run the sliders implemented.
Note that I have also included a main.cpp just to adjust the screen size.
